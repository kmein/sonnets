# sonnets

This program was crafted for the tiny puny intersection of literature nerds and
Haskell nerds. Its purpose is to find out which rhymes the Swan of Avon used in
his sonnets. To run it, you need [Stack](https://haskellstack.org) installed;
just execute `stack exec sonnets-exe` and the program will spit out a list of
first the number of occurrences followed by the rhyme pair.
